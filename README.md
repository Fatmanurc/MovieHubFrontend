The purpose of this project is to develop a comprehensive, scalable, and user-focused web 
platform named MovieHub. MovieHub enables users to explore, rate, and review movies and 
TV series. Inspired by widely-used platforms such as IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, it is designed 
to be interactive, feature-rich, and highly accessible. The project follows a modular full-stack 
architecture based on Java Spring Boot for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and 
PostgreSQL as the relational database.  
The platform is accessible via the following URL: https://moviehub-fe.onrender.com/
